//744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
//Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

//Examples:
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "a"
//Output: "c"
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "c"
//Output: "f"
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "d"
//Output: "f"
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "g"
//Output: "j"
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "j"
//Output: "c"
//Input:
//letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
//target = "k"
//Output: "c"
//Note:
//letters has a length in range [2, 10000].
//letters consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique letters.
//target is a lowercase letter.
