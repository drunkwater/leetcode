//686. Repeated String Match
//Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
//For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
//Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
//Note:
//The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
//class Solution {
//    func repeatedStringMatch(_ A: String, _ B: String) -> Int {
//    }
//}
