//258. Add Digits
//Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
//For example:
//Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
//Follow up:
//Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
//Credits:
//Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
