#205. Isomorphic Strings
#Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
#Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
#All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
#For example,
#Given "egg", "add", return true.
#Given "foo", "bar", return false.
#Given "paper", "title", return true.
#Note:
#You may assume both s and t have the same length.
## @param {String} s
## @param {String} t
## @return {Boolean}
#def is_isomorphic(s, t)
