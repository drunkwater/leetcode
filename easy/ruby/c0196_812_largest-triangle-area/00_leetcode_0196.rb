#812. Largest Triangle Area
#You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

#Output: 2
#Explanation: 
#The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.
#Notes:
#3 <= points.length <= 50.
#No points will be duplicated.
# -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
#Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
