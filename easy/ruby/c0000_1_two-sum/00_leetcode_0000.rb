#1. Two Sum
#Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#Example:
#Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
#Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
#return [0, 1].
# 
## @param {Integer[]} nums
## @param {Integer} target
## @return {Integer[]}
#def two_sum(nums, target)
#end
