#237. Delete Node in a Linked List
#Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
#Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
## Definition for singly-linked list.
## class ListNode
##     attr_accessor :val, :next
##     def initialize(val)
##         @val = val
##         @next = nil
##     end
## end
## @param {ListNode} node
## @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
#def delete_node(node)
#end
