#530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
#Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.
#Example:
#Input:
#   1
#    \
#     3
#    /
#   2
#Output:
#1
#Explanation:
#The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
#Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
## Definition for a binary tree node.
