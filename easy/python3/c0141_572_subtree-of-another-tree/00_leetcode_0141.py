#572. Subtree of Another Tree
#Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.
#Example 1:
#Given tree s:
#     3
#    / \
#   4   5
#  / \
# 1   2
#Given tree t:
#   4 
#  / \
# 1   2
#Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
#Example 2:
#Given tree s:
#     3
#    / \
#   4   5
#  / \
# 1   2
#    /
#   0
#Given tree t:
#   4
#  / \
# 1   2
#Return false.
#class Solution:
#    def isSubtree(self, s, t):
#        """
#        :type s: TreeNode
#        :type t: TreeNode
#        :rtype: bool
#        """
