//414. Third Maximum Number
//Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).
//Example 1:
//Input: [3, 2, 1]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
//Example 2:
//Input: [1, 2]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
//Example 3:
//Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
//Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
//class Solution {
//    fun thirdMax(nums: IntArray): Int {
//    }
//}
