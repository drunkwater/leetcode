//501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
//Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
//Assume a BST is defined as follows:
//The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
//The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
//Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
//For example:
//Given BST [1,null,2,2],
//   1
//    \
//     2
//    /
//   2
//return [2].
//Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.
//Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
