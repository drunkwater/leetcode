//409. Longest Palindrome
//Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.
//This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.
//Note:
//Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.
//Example:
//Input:
//"abccccdd"
//Output:
//7
//Explanation:
//One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
//object Solution {
//    def longestPalindrome(s: String): Int = {
//    }
//}
