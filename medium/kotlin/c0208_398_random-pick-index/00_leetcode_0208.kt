//398. Random Pick Index
//Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
//Note:
//The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.
//Example:
//int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
//Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
//// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
//solution.pick(3);
//// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
//solution.pick(1);
//class Solution(nums: IntArray) {
//    fun pick(target: Int): Int {
//    }
//}
///**
// * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
// * var obj = Solution(nums)
// * var param_1 = obj.pick(target)
// */
