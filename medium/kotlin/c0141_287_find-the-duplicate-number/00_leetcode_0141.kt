//287. Find the Duplicate Number
//Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
//Note:
//You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
//You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
//Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
//There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
