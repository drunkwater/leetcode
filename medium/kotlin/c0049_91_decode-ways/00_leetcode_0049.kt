//91. Decode Ways
//A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
//'A' -> 1
//'B' -> 2
//...
//'Z' -> 26
//Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
//Example 1:
//Input: "12"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
//Example 2:
//Input: "226"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
//class Solution {
//    fun numDecodings(s: String): Int {
//    }
