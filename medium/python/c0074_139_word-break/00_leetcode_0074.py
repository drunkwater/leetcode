#139. Word Break
#Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
#Note:
#The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
#You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
#Example 1:
#Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
#Output: true
#Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
#Example 2:
#Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
#Output: true
#Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
#             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
#Example 3:
#Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
#Output: false
#class Solution(object):
#    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
#        """
#        :type s: str
#        :type wordDict: List[str]
#        :rtype: bool
#        """
