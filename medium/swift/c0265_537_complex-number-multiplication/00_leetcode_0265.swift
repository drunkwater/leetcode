//537. Complex Number Multiplication
//Given two strings representing two complex numbers.
//You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition.
//Example 1:
//Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
//Output: "0+2i"
//Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
//Example 2:
//Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
//Output: "0+-2i"
//Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
//Note:
//The input strings will not have extra blank.
//The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be also in this form.
//class Solution {
//    func complexNumberMultiply(_ a: String, _ b: String) -> String {
//    }
//}
