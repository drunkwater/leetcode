//368. Largest Divisible Subset
//Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.
//If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.
//Example 1:
//nums: [1,2,3]
//Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
//Example 2:
//nums: [1,2,4,8]
//Result: [1,2,4,8]
