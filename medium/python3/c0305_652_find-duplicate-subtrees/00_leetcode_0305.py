#652. Find Duplicate Subtrees
#Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.
#Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.
#Example 1:
#        1
#       / \
#      2   3
#     /   / \
#    4   2   4
#       /
#      4
#The following are two duplicate subtrees:
#      2
#     /
#    4
#and
#    4
#Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.
#class Solution:
#    def findDuplicateSubtrees(self, root):
#        """
#        :type root: TreeNode
#        :rtype: List[TreeNode]
#        """
