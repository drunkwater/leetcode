#There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
#Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
#We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.
#Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
#Example:
#Input:
#n = 9,
#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#2 4 6 8
#2 6
