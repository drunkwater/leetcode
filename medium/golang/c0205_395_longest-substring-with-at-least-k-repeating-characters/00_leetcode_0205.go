//395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
//Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
//Example 1:
//Input:
//s = "aaabb", k = 3
//Output:
//3
//The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
//Example 2:
//Input:
//s = "ababbc", k = 2
//Output:
//5
//The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
//func longestSubstring(s string, k int) int {
//}
