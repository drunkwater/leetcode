//230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
//Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
//Note:
//You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
//Follow up:
//What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
//Credits:
//Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
