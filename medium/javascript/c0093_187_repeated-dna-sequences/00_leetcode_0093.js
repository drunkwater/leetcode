//187. Repeated DNA Sequences
//All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
//Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
//For example,
//Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
//Return:
//["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
///**
// * @param {string} s
// * @return {string[]}
// */
//var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
//};
