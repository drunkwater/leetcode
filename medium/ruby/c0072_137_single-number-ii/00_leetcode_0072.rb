#137. Single Number II
#Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
#Note:
#Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
#Example 1:
#Input: [2,2,3,2]
#Output: 3
#Example 2:
#Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
#Output: 99
## @param {Integer[]} nums
## @return {Integer}
#def single_number(nums)
#end
