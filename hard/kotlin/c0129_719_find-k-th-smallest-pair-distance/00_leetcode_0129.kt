//719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance
//Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.
//Example 1:
//Input:
//nums = [1,3,1]
//k = 1
//Output: 0 
//Explanation:
//Here are all the pairs:
//(1,3) -> 2
//(1,1) -> 0
//(3,1) -> 2
//Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
//Note:
//2 <= len(nums) <= 10000.
//0 <= nums[i] < 1000000.
//1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2.
//class Solution {
//    fun smallestDistancePair(nums: IntArray, k: Int): Int {
//    }
//}
