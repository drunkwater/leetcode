//128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
//Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
//Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
//Example:
//Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
//class Solution {
//    fun longestConsecutive(nums: IntArray): Int {
//    }
//}
