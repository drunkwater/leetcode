#Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
#Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
# 
#The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
#  Example:
#Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
#Output: 10
