#Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
#What if duplicates are allowed?
#Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
#Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
#(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
#Find the minimum element.
#The array may contain duplicates.

#    def findMin(self, nums):

#        :type nums: List[int]
#        :rtype: int
